  <p class="news__p"><span class="news__dateline">Cambridge, Massachusetts</span> – India has the potential to be the fastest growing economy over the coming decade, according to new growth projections presented by researchers at the Center for International Development at Harvard University (CID). The researchers use their newly updated measure, economic complexity, which captures the diversity and sophistication of productive capabilities embedded in a country’s exports, to generate the growth projections.  The projections reflect the latest 2014 trade data available. The global landscape for economic growth that results shows greatest potential for rapid growth in South Asia and East Africa. Conversely, oil economies and other commodity-driven economies face the slowest growth outlook.</p>

  <p class="news__p">India tops the global list for predicted annual growth rate for the coming decade, at 7.0 percent. This far outpaces projections for its northern neighbor and economic rival, China, which the researchers expect to face a continued slowdown to 4.3 percent growth annually to 2024.</p>

  <p class="news__p">“India has made important gains in diversifying exports into more complex products in chemicals, vehicles, even electronics,” said Ricardo Hausmann, Professor of the Practice of Economic Development at Harvard Kennedy School (HKS), the leading researcher of The Atlas of Economic Complexity (<a href="http://www.atlas.cid.harvard.edu">www.atlas.cid.harvard.edu</a>), and the director of CID.</p>

  <p class="news__p">Hausmann notes these gains in economic complexity have historically translated into higher incomes. “China has already realized many of these gains, doubling per capita income in less than a decade. We expect India’s recent gains in complexity to drive higher incomes, as we find India is poised to lead global economic growth over the coming decade,” Hausmann said.</p>

  <p class="news__p">Growth in emerging markets is predicted to continue to outpace that of advanced economies, though the gap is closing. The CID projections are also bullish on East Africa. Five East African countries – Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Madagascar, and Zambia – rank in the top ten, with all predicted to grow at least 5.5 percent annually. The growth forecast also looks favorably on Southeast Asia, where the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam look to drive growth well above global averages. Growth in advanced economies remains slow by comparison, though it has risen slightly in the projections in recent years. The U.S. is expected to grow at 2.8 percent annually to 2024, with higher growth predicted in the United Kingdom and Spain, and slower growth in Italy and Germany.</p>

  <p class="news__p">The projections are based on a decade of research into the economic complexity measure, which the researchers argue, isolates one consistent fact: countries that export complex products, which require greater diversity of knowledge to produce them, grow faster than those that export simple products. Economic complexity shows remarkable accuracy in predicting future economic growth—with five times greater accuracy than the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index.</p>

  <p class="news__p">“Sustained economic growth is fundamentally human-driven: the greater the diversity of productive knowledge in a place, the more the complex products it can make, which underpins income gains,” said Timothy Cheston, a CID researcher on the project.</p>

  <h4 class="news__subhead">New Economic Complexity Index</h4>
  <p class="news__p">Along with the growth projections, CID released new country rankings in the 2014 Economic Complexity Index (ECI). The ECI ranks countries based on the average complexity of their export basket, using the same measure that generated the growth projections. The top of the rankings continue to find Japan, Germany, and Switzerland holding the greatest economic complexity, while Great Britain (10th), the United States, (13th) and France (16th) have all slid. The countries that have slipped fastest in the rankings, with worsening complexity, are concentrated among oil economies, most notably Venezuela and Azerbaijan. The top gainers concentrate in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Notably, many of the countries that have made the greatest improvements in their complexity have achieved the fastest growth in per capita income over the past decade, including China (ECI rank: up 16 positions to rank 17th globally) and South Korea (up 11 positions to rank 4th).</p>

  <p class="news__p">CID researchers noted numerous cases where previous iterations of the predictions have played out in reality. Greece has long factored as an outlier for having a higher income level than expected for its level of complexity, predicting a dip in growth. Even after a decade that averaged negative growth, the new projections show continued low growth prospects for Greece. In Latin America, Brazil’s significant decline in the complexity rankings over the past decade can be seen as predicting its recent recession, though new data show optimism for the country’s ability to return to moderate growth. For countries that have diminished the diversity of their production, particularly towards a dependency on low-complexity natural resources, such as Venezuela’s reliance on oil, recent declines in oil prices and the resulting severe recession closely follow the model’s predictions.</p>

  <p class="news__p">The economic complexity approach provides a series of challenging questions for policymakers looking to diversify their production to strengthen growth. CID research into how complex firms start in a location finds that new know-how often arrives from outside the community.</p>

  <p class="news__p">“Immigration policy must confront the fact that many of the firms that help diversify a country and drive its growth are started by immigrants,” Hausmann said.</p>

  <p class="news__p">In education policy, the economic complexity approach points to a need to move beyond goals for universal general education to focus on expanding the diversity of specialized productive know-how.</p>
