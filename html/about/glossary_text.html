<h4>Economic Complexity</h4>
<p>A measure of the capabilities and know-how that goes into the production of any given product.</p> 

<p>The production of a product requires multiple stages. To make a shirt, one needs to design it, make the fabric, cut it, sew it, pack it, brand it, market it and distribute it. An individual is unable to hold the amount of know-how and capabilities to conduct every stage, thus the production of the shirt requires multiple people with different capabilities to work together. Some countries produce more complex products than others, products that require larger amounts of know-how and collective capabilities. Rich countries typically produce these more complex products because they possess the most advanced productive capabilities, while poor countries produce more simple products. 

<h4>Economic Complexity Indicator<h4>
<p>To determine the Economic Complexity Index of a country we examine two characteristics:</p>
1.	Diversity of a country: how many products does a country make?
2.	Ubiquity of a product: how many countries are able to make a product?
We then use one measure as an input to the other measure. 

<h4>The Product Space</h4>

<p>A map that visualizes the products a country currently produces, and the feasibility of and trajectory for product diversification.</p>

Countries grow by expanding their productive knowledge, producing more complex products and increasing their level of economic complexity. But how and what capabilities should countries be developing? The location of a country within The Product Space illustrates the trajectory it could take to diversify. The Product Space details nearly 800 products into 34 color-coded communities. If a country makes one product, we can estimate how easy it is to obtain the capabilities to make another product by its “distance” in The Product Space from it. 

<h4>Capability Distance</h4>

<p>A measure of how easy it is for a country to obtain the know-how to make a specific product based on its existing capabilities. The “Capability Distance” is depicted visually in The Product Space.</p>

<h4>Expected Growth</h4>

<p>Our predictions for how and to what extent countries will grow, dependent upon their location within The Product Space and current GDPs.</p>
