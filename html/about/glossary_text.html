<h4>Capability Distance</h4> 

<p>It measures a country’s ability to make a specific product, based upon its current export basket and productive capabilities.</p>

<p>We describe this ability in terms of ‘distance’ because it is easier to understand how far a country is from manufacturing more complex products as a physical measure, but also because it refers to distance on the Product Space. If product A is said to be “near” a country in capability distance, it means that the knowledge required to make product A is similar to the knowledge required to make a product the country can already produce. This means that the likelihood the country will begin to manufacture product A within 5-10 years is high.</p>

<p>We calculate distance by the proportion of knowledge relevant to a product that the country does not have. The knowledge that the country does have is measured by the proximity between products it is currently making and the product of interest P. The knowledge it does not have is measured by the proximity between products it is not making and the product of interest P. Distance is therefore the sum of the proximities between good P and all the products that country C is not currently exporting, normalized by the sum of proximities between all products and product P.</p>

<a name="diversity"></a>
<h4>Diversity</h4>

<p>measures how many different types of products a country is able to make.</p> 

<p>Diversity expresses the amount of knowledge or personbytes a country holds and is able to convert into the production of goods.<p>

<a name="export"></a>
<h4>Export</h4>
<p>Goods and services that are shipped out of a country.</p>

<h4>Trade Flow</h4>
<p>Type of exchange between two given countries.</p>

<a name="economiccomplexity"></a>
<h4>Economic Complexity</h4>
<p>is intuitively a measure of the knowledge in a society that gets translated into the products it makes.</p>

<p>The most complex products are sophisticated chemicals and machinery, whereas the world’s least complex products are raw materials or simple agricultural products. The economic complexity of a country is connected to the complexity of the products it exports. A country is considered ‘complex’ if it exports not only highly complex products (determined by the product complexity index), but also a large number of different products.</p>

<p>To calculate the economic complexity of a country, we measure the average ubiquity of the products it exports, the average diversity of the countries that make those products and so forth.</p>

<a name="eci"></a>
<h4>Economic Complexity Indicator</h4>
<p>ranks how diversified and complex a country’s export basket is.</p>

<p>ECI is a scale that shows which countries are economically complex and which are not. 
We refer the productive capabilities of a country by its diversity (how many different products it can produce) refined by the ubiquity of those products (the number of countries able to make those products). We can further refine this calculation by looking at the diversity of the countries that make those products and the ubiquity of the products those countries make. After a few iterations of this, the process converges and represents our quantitative measures of complexity that we refer to as the Economic Complexity Index.</p>

<a name="expectedgrowth"></a>
<h4>Expected Growth</h4>

<p>predicts the degree to which a country will grow dependent upon its current level of Economic Complexity, its location within The Product Space, as well as current GDP. We can therefore calculate projected growth for the next 5-10 years for any given country.</p>

<p>To calculate the expected growth we consider four factors as explanatory factors: the level of income; the Economic Complexity Index; the Complexity Outlook Index; and the expected growth in the value of natural resource exports per capita.</p>


<a name="nearby"></a>
<h4>Nearby (adjacent possible)</h4> 

<p>describes a product that requires similar productive capabilities to another product. Countries preferentially develop products for which most of the requisite productive capabilities are already present—they diversify into the nearby.</p>

<p> When a country has an abundance of nearby products, it has an easier path to capability acquisition, product diversification and development.</p>

<a name="productiveknowledge"></a>
<h4>Productive Knowledge</h4> 

<p>is a form of knowledge or know-how to produce things; countries accumulate productive knowledge by developing the capability to make a larger variety of products of increasing complexity.</p>


<a name="pci"></a>
<h4>Product Complexity Index</h4> 

<p>is a measure of how complex a product is, calculated as the mathematical limit of a measure based on how many countries export the product and how diversified those exporters are.</p>

<a name="productspace"></a>
<h4>The Product Space</h4>

<p>is a map that depicts the network of possible export products, and shows paths through which productive knowledge is more easily accumulated.</p>

<p>Export products that require similar productive knowledge and capabilities to produce sit in closer proximity to one another in the Product Space. Using data on what a given country produces and exports, we are able to place that country within the Product Space, illustrating their productive capabilities and allowing us to identify products that lie "nearby".
 
<a name="proximity"></a>
<h4>Proximity</h4> 

<p>is a characteristic of a pair of products, showing how close the products are located to one another within the Product Space.</p> 

<p>It measures the minimum probability that a country exports product 1 given that it exports product 2, or vice versa.</p>

<h4>Revealed Comparative Advantage</h4>

<a name="ubiquity"></a>
<h4>Ubiquity</h4> 

<p>measures the number of countries that are able to make a product.</p>






<h4>The Product Space</h4>

<p>A map that visualizes the products a country currently produces, and the feasibility of and trajectory for product diversification.</p>

Countries grow by expanding their productive knowledge, producing more complex products and increasing their level of economic complexity. But how and what capabilities should countries be developing? The location of a country within The Product Space illustrates the trajectory it could take to diversify. The Product Space details nearly 800 products into 34 color-coded communities. If a country makes one product, we can estimate how easy it is to obtain the capabilities to make another product by its “distance” in The Product Space from it. 

<h4>Capability Distance</h4>

<p>A measure of how easy it is for a country to obtain the know-how to make a specific product based on its existing capabilities. The “Capability Distance” is depicted visually in The Product Space.</p>

<h4>Expected Growth</h4>

<p>Our predictions for how and to what extent countries will grow, dependent upon their location within The Product Space and current GDPs.</p>
